# Progress Log
## Project SLAM

---

**Jan 31, 2022 ~ Mar 3, 2022**

**Completed:**
 1. Learning basics of linear algebra; reading the text book of Tongji
 University, *Xianxing Diashu* [*Linear Algebra*].
 2. Learning the principle of and have implemented perspective projection
 (implemented on TI-CAS Graphic Calculator).
 3. Learning graphic transformation based on homogeneous matrix.
 (Zhihu, related online course video, and *SLAM Shisijiang*
 [*Fourteen Chapters of SLAM*].)
 4. Practices based on *Shijue SLAM Shisijiang: Conglilun Daoshijian*
 [*Fourteen Chapters of Visual SLAM: Theories and Practices*].
    a. Usage of library Eigen.
    b. Geometric transformation and reference frame transformation based
    on library Eigen.
    c. Visualization based on OpenGL.
 5. Basics of binocular camera and RGB-D camera.

**Discussion:**
 1. Still not understanding quaternion, including its geometric meaning.
 2. Reference frame transformation method in the book is different from my
 own.

**TODO:**
 1. ORB3-SLAM model.
 2. RTAB-MAP model.
 3. Visualization of the training process and the result.
